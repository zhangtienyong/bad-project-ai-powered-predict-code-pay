# Bad Project: AI-Powered Predict Code Pay

## Overview
This project, "Bad Project: AI-Powered Predict Code Pay," is a combination of machine learning models and a web application for predicting code payment behavior. This README provides an overview of the project structure and how to get started.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `machine_learning_models/`: Contains machine learning models and related code.
    - `code/`: Machine learning code and model files.
    - `README.md`: Documentation specific to the machine learning component.

- `web_application/`: Houses the web application code.
    - `code/`: Web application code, templates, and static files.
    - `README.md`: Documentation specific to the web application component.

- `README.md`: This top-level README file providing an overview of the entire project.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Navigate to the `machine_learning_models/` directory.
   - Refer to the `README.md` file within this directory for detailed instructions on setting up and running the machine learning component.

2. **Web Application:**
   - Navigate to the `web_application/` directory.
   - Check the `README.md` file within this directory for instructions on running the web application component.

## Database Structure
The project relies on a database for various functionalities. The database structure consists of the following elements:

- **Image**: This is the project logo that you can find in the `data/database/image` directory. You can view it here: [bad-project-ai-powered-predict-code-pay.png](web-application/data/database/image/bad-project-ai-powered-predict-code-pay.png).

- **SQL Scripts**: The SQL scripts used in the project can be found in the `data/database/sql` directory. These scripts may include tables, queries, and other database-related files.
